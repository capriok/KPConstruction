                Very honest, hard working folks who take pride in their work and are
                perfectionists and talented. You can&#39;t go wrong! Plus, they are
                fantastic people who helped us when we moved to Bandon, had four boxers,
                and no way to contain them. They put up two separate fenced yards in a
                very short time!
